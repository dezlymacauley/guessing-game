# Guessing Game

#### Here's how it works:

- The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 50 
- The player will be prompted to enter a guess.
- If the player's guess is incorrect, a hint will be displayed.
- The hint will tell the player if their guess is too high or too low.
- If the guess is correct the game will display a congratulatory message.
